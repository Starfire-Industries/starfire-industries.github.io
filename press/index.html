			March 13 that mass firings of probationary federal workers in February were illegal, including National Park

			&nbsp;However, any compliance from DOI remains to be seen.</span></p>
	<p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
	<p class="c1"><span class="c4">In the hearing, Judge Alsup remarked that a clear pattern emerged with agencies
			citing underperformance in their terminations, despite workers having earned favorable reviews. "It is a
			sad, sad day,” said Alsup, “when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on
			performance when they know good and well that’s a lie.” </span></p>
	<p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
	<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Resistance Rangers will not see this ruling as a win until illegally terminated
			employees from all agencies outlined in the court’s rulings are reinstated in their roles, with back pay and
			their records cleared. As Judge Alsup noted, it is critical that these employees have the false accusation
			of “poor performance” removed from their records.</span></p>

	<p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
	<p class="c1"><span class="c4">We urge the public to contact Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and Secretary of

	<p class="c1"><span class="c4">“Along with many others, I was fired for ‘underperformance’ on February 14, despite

			Capital Parks-East Unit. “With this illegal firing on my record, I have struggled to obtain unemployment
			benefits, to explain the situation in job interviews, acquire new health insurance coverage, and to attempt
			to move on with my life. I am eager to get back to work serving the American public, but I can’t do that
			until the agency complies with court orders.”</span></p>
