The Legend of SilverHeels

This is the tale of SilverHeels, a mysterious and inspiring figure...

  It is 1861, in a town called Buckskin Joeâ€™s in South Park in the Rocky Mountains, there is 
an unnamed girl who they called Silverheels.  Silverheels was a dancer at the towns dance hall. 
She was known to be the most beautiful girl in all the land when she took off her veil, this led her 
to be one of the most famous dancers at Buckskin Joe.  All of the miners fell in love with her. 
One day two sheepherders came to Buckskin Joe And gave all the miners smallpox.  All the 
woman and the children fled from town, but not Silverheels. 

  It was said that Silverheels stayed to help the miners because she was thankful for all they 
did for her.  She stayed and helped the miners until one day she herself got smallpox.  It was said 
that smallpox melted away her beauty, so she left town not wanting anyone to see her.  One day 
the miners who she helped wanted to give her a gift, but they found that she was not at her home. 
The miners still wanted to pay their respects and so they named a mountain after her.
